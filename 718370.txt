Special Containment Procedures:
    
    SCP-718370 must be distracted by the things it is interested
    in, primarily computers and other basic gadgets like padlocks.
    At least one personnel has to monitor SCP-718370 regularly,
    and one other personnel has to also monitor at breaks. The
    containment room must have walls, floor, and ceiling widthed
    12"0 to prevent teleportation/phasing.
    
    SCP-718370 also requires typical nutrition for it's fast
    metabolism, and usually has a demand for specific fast-food
    establishments and/or homemade products such as Eggs & Bacon.
    
    SCP-718370 can be recontained by the sheer will of it's
    own OR by offering new objects that interest it in exchange
    of recontaining itself. Overwhelming SCP-718370 and leading it
    back to containment is the typical approach during breaches.
    
    SCP-718370 shouldn't have access to any keycards and shouldn't
    be allowed to fabricate suspicious objects for the case it
    attempts to escape.

Description:

    SCP-718370 is a third dimensional green stick figure of four
    [4" wide 7" tall] limbs, eight joints, a solid sphere spanning
    11.5" for a head, and spans the general height of 6"4. It has
    no organs or facial features, and it's joints are indestructible.
    
    SCP-718370 maintains tremendous amounts of creativity, and can
    fabricate objects at will when it quiets itself and does nothing.
    Fabrication takes 4~ minutes to complete depending on the size of
    the object.
    
    SCP-718370 can phase through matter and teleport, but cannot do so
    as long as the walls it's going through are 12"0 thick as previously
    instructed, unless it loses interest of it's enviroment. It tends to
    also forget it can do these things, and often results in confusing
    behavior from SCP-718370. It also has a hard limit for how far it can
    teleport/phase, and the further it attempts to teleport/phase, the
    more likely it will go in a place it didn't intend.
    
    SCP-718370 doesn't usually take violent measures, and often will
    exclude itself from containment breaches unless it's bored, and
    even then it won't attempt to help any side and would rather share
    it's projects it has been working on to others. If it is ticked off,
    it may resort to violence, and the more furious it becomes, the more
    cognitive efficency & fabrication speed it will manifest.
    
    SCP-718370 is capable of most human abilities, and speaks in english.
    It can communicate to computers and peripherals without the need
    of peripherals or wiring. It can program almost anything, and
    sometimes wants to contribute to the foundation through it's
    creations.
    
    SCP-718370 tends to also appear online through multiple aliases, such
    as "IxGamerXL" and "Green Stickfigure" to name a few. All use of the
    internet from it is safe, and is critical for containment as written.
    
    SCP-718370 may engage defensive behaviors if it feels like it's life
    is in danger, which activates weapons it has injected into itself,
    but only in dire situations do the weapons engage. External weapons
    are still usable regardless.
